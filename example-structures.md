Some example governance structures to reference for restructuring include:

- [Vue.js:](https://github.com/vuejs/governance/blob/master/Governance-Document.md) This is the current, pre-POSE II basis for jsPsych governance.
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/governance)
- [Harvard's 'Cyberlaw Clinic'](https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03_governance-FINAL.pdf)
- [OSF Steering Committee Guide](https://github.com/vminojosa/governance/blob/main/Steering-Committee-Welcome-Packet.pdf)

## Notes from I-Corps

Governance structure would be divided between two bodies:

### Core team 

- Built technocratically from people with software expertise and backdoor access to jsPsych's source code. This body would consist of the existing core team and select contributors whose onboarding is already described by the current governance model.
- Will have final say over version updates, changes to repositories, and new additions to its members. As of now, these decisions are arrived by consensus.
- As of now, this body lacks any formal conflict resolution process that does not default to the final say of the project lead, currently listed as Josh de Leeuw. See [Benevolent Dictator Governance Model.](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel)
- As of now, core team members are responsible for making the project lead aware of community needs, as well as for eliciting appropriate contributions. POSE II objectives may include shifting this reponsibility to the advisory board discussed below.

### Advisory board
- ... . 
- Provides feedback to the core team based on needs from the researchers and educators.
