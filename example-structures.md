# Restructuring jsPsych Governance

Some example governance structures to reference for restructuring include:

- [Vue.js:](https://github.com/vuejs/governance/blob/master/Governance-Document.md) This is the current, pre-POSE II basis for jsPsych governance.
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/governance)
- [Harvard's 'Cyberlaw Clinic'](https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03_governance-FINAL.pdf)
- [OSF Steering Committee Guide](https://github.com/vminojosa/governance/blob/main/Steering-Committee-Welcome-Packet.pdf)

## Notes from I-Corps

Governance structure would be divided between two bodies:

### Core Team, or Technical Board

- Built technocratically from people with software expertise and backdoor access to jsPsych's source code. This body would consist of the existing core team and select contributors whose onboarding is already described by the current governance model.
- Will have final say over version updates, changes to repositories, and new additions to its members. As of now, these decisions are arrived by consensus.
- As of now, this body lacks any formal conflict resolution process that does not default to the final say of the project lead, currently listed as Josh de Leeuw. See [Benevolent Dictator Governance Model.](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel)
- As of now, core team members are responsible for making the project lead aware of community needs, as well as for eliciting appropriate contributions. POSE II objectives may include shifting this reponsibility to the advisory board discussed below.

### Advisory board, or Community Council
- ... . 
- Provides feedback to the core team based on needs from the researchers and educators.

## Notes on Example Structures

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu's governance model is currently distributed bicamerally between two sides: Community Council and Technical Board

#### Community Council (CC)

- One of Ubuntu's governance goals is to ensure that "There is a defined process that helps people participate in decisions regarding the Ubuntu community and distribution." The challenge this goal addresses mirrors our participation goals more broadly for jsPsych, but it's unclear to what extent shifts in governance structure will actively inform / be informed by approaches to community engagement.
    - Just spitballing: Could develop the CC structure into a pipeline for potential contributors to build up participation and be possibly invited to join the core team.

- Ubuntu's CC is itself currently positioned hierarchically in relation to various subsidiary team councils with delegated responsibilities.
    - This hierachical distribution of responsibilities obviously won't apply to jsPsych right away, but it can be built towards. For now, we can house these responsibilities under the single community council, like Ubuntu's before the emergence of team councils.
    - The responsibilities currently relegated to Ubuntu's current iteration of CC can set a blueprint for [conflict resolution.](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/governance/conflict-resolution)

- Team Councils: Assesses, maintains, and represents the health of specific projects or sub-communities.
    - Some team councils represent regional "local council (LoCo)" teams. These could be analogous to specific universities or university networks for jsPsych.
    - Others represent specific developer communities in the Ubuntu ecosystem, like Lubuntu and KDE's Kubuntu. These could be analogous to jsPsych's ecosystem partners, like CHS, Pushkin, World Wide Lab and Music Lab.
    - Others still focus on communicative platforms, like IRC, Matrix or conventional forums.

- Operations Teams

- Members Teams: Tracks and identifies participation and major contribution from specific members within the community.
    - This work is currently represented in jsPsych's contributor count repositories, as well as its more recent working dashboard.

#### Technical Board

### Cyberlaw Clinic

- This article identifies Ubuntu's governance model as "delegated governance," which is characterized by (1) authority centralized at the top and distributed down a chain of command, (2) diverse forms of community leadership, and (3) varied control over project direction, depending on how non-technical councils are selected.

- States that community councils may be selected by founding team first before opening up to community-wide elections. As mentioned above, this transition can effect the pace at which project directions change with turnover in this body.
