Some example governance structures to reference for restructuring include:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/governance)
- [Harvard's 'Cyberlaw Clinic'](https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017-03_governance-FINAL.pdf)
- [OSF Steering Committee Guide](https://github.com/vminojosa/governance/blob/main/Steering-Committee-Welcome-Packet.pdf)

## Notes from I-Corps

Governance structure would be divided between two bodies:

### Core maintenance team 

- Built technocratically from people with software expertise and backdoor access to jsPsych's source code. 
- Will have final say over version updates, changes to repositories, and new additions to its members.

### Advisory board
- ... . 
- Provides feedback to the core team based on needs from the researchers and educators.
