- One of Ubuntu's governance goals is to ensure that "There is a defined process that helps people participate in decisions regarding the Ubuntu community and distribution." The challenge this goal addresses mirrors our participation goals more broadly for jsPsych, but it's unclear to what extent shifts in governance structure will actively inform / be informed by approaches to community engagement.
    - Just spitballing: Could develop the CC structure into a pipeline for potential contributors to build up participation and be possibly invited to join the core team.

- Ubuntu's CC is itself currently positioned hierarchically in relation to various subsidiary team councils with delegated responsibilities.
    - This hierachical distribution of responsibilities obviously won't apply to jsPsych right away, but it can be built towards. For now, we can house these responsibilities under the single community council, like Ubuntu's before the emergence of team councils.
    - The responsibilities currently relegated to Ubuntu's current iteration of CC can set a blueprint for [conflict resolution.](https://ubuntu.com/community/docs/governance/conflict-resolution)

- Team Councils: Assesses, maintains, and represents the health of specific projects or sub-communities.
    - Some team councils represent regional "local council (LoCo)" teams. These could be analogous to specific universities or university networks for jsPsych.
    - Others represent specific developer communities in the Ubuntu ecosystem, like Lubuntu and KDE's Kubuntu. These could be analogous to jsPsych's ecosystem partners, like CHS, Pushkin, World Wide Lab and Music Lab.
    - Others still focus on communicative platforms, like IRC, Matrix or conventional forums.

- Operations Teams

- Members Teams: Tracks and identifies participation and major contribution from specific members within the community.
    - This work is currently represented in jsPsych's contributor count repositories, as well as its more recent working dashboard.
