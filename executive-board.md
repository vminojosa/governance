## 4. Organizational Structure

**Meeting Frequency:** Monthly  
**Meeting Format:** Virtual, with minutes kept for transparency. Agendas will be shared at least a week ahead of each meeting.  
**Decision-Making:** Decisions are made by consensus. If consensus is not possible, the executive director will make a final call, with input from other members.

<!-- add stuff on spending (e.g. if outside contractors are hired, fixed costs (like hosting site), direct hires vs hired through affiliated institutions), roadmapping (and make sure it's updated on an annual basis), and funding outside of grants (i.e. user fees) -->

## 5. Decision-Making Authority
The executive board plays a **decisive role** in prioritizing projects for developing and sustaining the jsPsych ecosystem. It must:

- Set the project roadmap, made available to the public.
- Sponsor projects through the available budget.
- Manage a transparent funding portfolio, including grants and other forms of sustained income.
- Balance spending budget for all fixed costs and allocations through affiliate institutions.
- Tap expertise where relevant within advisory board to support grant bids.
- Hear the advisory board every 6 months. E-board is not bound to any decisions recommended by Ad-Board but will use them to evaluate the sustainability of the ecosystem, current and future projects, and budgetary concerns.
- **Placeholder for decisions about IP, for platforms like Yale Ventures**

## 6. Responsibilities

- Identify gaps and opportunities in the jsPsych open-source community, as well as the larger open science ecosystem.
- Seek out and sustain a diverse streams of revenue for jsPsych as a project and open-science ecosystem.
- Propose, evaluate, and sponsor new technical projects or areas for developing jsPsych.
- Assess success and sustainability of current projects, as well as the health of the community and ecosystem.
