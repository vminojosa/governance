## 1. Mission Statement
- The executive board's role is to set administrative priorities for the larger ecosystem. This role is primarily actualized through its power to write grants and set the project's funding timeline. 

## 2. Membership
- Electing members onto executive board... (will anyone have a spot reserved?)

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
- Chair of the executive board will be listed as the primary applicant or PI for research grants. Other governance officers(?) may be invited to join the application, but will not be required to.

## 4. Organizational Structure
...

## 5. Decision-Making Authority
- [Should add something here about IP decisions, since getting funding through stuff like Yale ventures would require giving the IP to an institution (e.g. Yale) to make legal decisions on behalf of the governance structure]

## 6. Responsibilities
...

## 7. Reporting Procedures
- The executive board will review ecosystem reports by the CC and TB but is not bound to carry out any decisions outlined therein.
- Grant timelines will break down funding allocation among ecosystem partners. This will include any hiring needs, as well as whether hires will be made from within or outside of the governance structure. 
- Funding timelines will be distributed throughout the governance structure at least (review period) before the start of the next grantwriting period.

## 8. Meeting Procedures
- The executive board must meet (once? twice?) each (funding period?) to take inventory of active funding, then describe any new/sustained funding priorities in a timeline/portfolio for the next (funding period). 
- All grant timelines must be approved by a quorum (or unanimous?) of the executive board.

## 9. Conflict Resolution
- (will either CC or TB have any kind of mechanism for signaling disapproval or vetoing grant writing decisions? Maybe a quorum veto? or nothing...?)

## 10. Amendment Procedures
- Electing the chair of the executive board... (unless it's just always Josh; can just make Josh CFL until otherwise indicated)
