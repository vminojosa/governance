## 1. Mission Statement
The executive board's role is to set administrative priorities for the larger ecosystem. This role is primarily actualized through its power to apply for grant and determine the ecosystem's roadmap. 

## 2. Membership

#### Composition:

Board consists of 3-5 members from across project contributors and ecosystem partners. Members represent funding interests from a diversity of perspectives in the jsPsych open-source community. **(anything about Josh de Leeuw as board lead? that's an easy solution without articulating an election process right away, especially if Josh has been BDFL for so long)**

#### Terms:

- Board members serve 1-year renewable terms, reviewed annually.
- Option to continue into next consecutive year (no maximum).
- Rolling membership review every 12 months to ensure continuity and renewal.

#### Selection:
Members are invited by the board lead or nominated by current members, with final appointments approved by unanimous vote.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities
Name | Role | Description
-----|------|-------
Josh de Leeuw | jsPsych Executive Board Lead | Creator and project lead for jsPsych
Josh Hartshorne | Pushkin & World Wide Lab Project Lead | ...
Melissa Kline | Children Helping Science Project Lead | ...
Sam Mehr | Music Lab Project Lead | ...

#### Board Member Expectations:
- Attend regular meetings.
- Review community insights and technical recommendations.
- Review active grants and set the next slate of grant applications.
- Serve as applicants for grant funding when delegated by the board lead, who will serve as primary applicant by default.

## 4. Organizational Structure

**Meeting Frequency:** Monthly  
**Meeting Format:** Virtual, with minutes kept for transparency. Agendas will be shared at least a week ahead of each meeting.  
**Decision-Making:** Decisions are made by consensus. If consensus is not possible, the board lead will make a final call, with input from other members.

## 5. Decision-Making Authority
The executive board plays a **decisive role** in setting the funding timeline for the ecosystem. To this end, it must:

- Manage the ecosystem's grant portfolio as applicants.
- Prioritize projects in need of grant funding.
- Review reports from the community council (CC) and technical board (TB). The board is not bound to any decisions recommended therein but will use them to identify priority projects and develop roadmaps.
- Tap expertise within CC and TB to support grant bids.
- **[Should add something here about IP decisions, since getting funding through stuff like Yale ventures would require giving the IP to an institution (e.g. Yale) to make legal decisions on behalf of the governance structure]**

## 6. Responsibilities

- Identify gaps and opportunities in the jsPsych open science ecosystem.
- Nominate, evaluate, and administer new technical projects or areas of development.
- Assess success and sustainability of current projects, as well as the ecosystem as a whole.
- Collaborate with the community council (CC) and technical board (TB) leads to inform roadmap development.
- Assist in resolving community concerns, partner disputes or conflicts of interest.

## 7. Reporting Procedures

- The executive board will distribute a **(quarterly? bi-annual? annual?) Grant Report** to recognized stakeholders, including CC and TB, for transparency and feedback.
- The report will list active grants and future grant bids. Each entry will include applicants, a description of each grant, supported projects.
- Active grants will list the end of their funding period. Grant bids will list an internal submission deadline, as well as projected funding allocation.
- **(placeholder for if we want to give a review period to the rest of governance, otherwise feedback doesn't really matter until the next reporting period)**

## 8. Meeting Procedures

- **Agenda:** Sent at least 1 week prior to meetings by the lead.
- **Quorum:** At least 50% of current members
- **Voting:** Informal voting may occur to gauge support for recommendations, but consensus and discussion are prioritized
- **Notes:** Meeting minutes will be circulated after each session and archived internally

## 9. Conflict Resolution

The board plays an proactive role in resolving conflicts both within the board and within the broader ecosystem.

- **Internal Conflicts:** Disagreements among committee members are addressed through respectful discussion. If unresolved, the lead will mediate via progressive stack before making a final decision.
- **Ecosystem Disputes:** The board serves as a neutral **(Note: talk over maintaining neutrality with Josh)** advisory group to navigate disputes within the jsPsych ecosystem. Members may review cases, provide guidance, and recommend actions to project leads in alignment with ecosystem values. **(Note: will there be a publicly available Code of Conduct or Values Statement to assess/demonstrate alignment?)**

## 10. Amendment Procedures

- Any member of the board can propose an amendment to this charter.
- Amendments require review and approval by consensus.
- Approved amendments will be communicated to all members of governance and reflected in the next board meeting.
