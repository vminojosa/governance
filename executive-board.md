## Applying for Funding
- The executive board's role is to set administrative priorities for the larger ecosystem. This role is primarily actualized through its power to write grants and set the project's funding timeline. 
- The executive board must meet (once? twice?) each (funding period?) to take inventory of active funding, then describe any new/sustained funding priorities in a timeline/portfolio for the next (funding period). 
- Grant timelines will break down funding allocation among ecosystem partners. This will include any hiring needs, as well as whether hires will be made from within or outside of the governance structure. 
- The executive board will review ecosystem reports by the CC and TB but is not bound to carry out any decisions outlined therein.
- Chair of the executive board will be listed as the primary applicant or PI for research grants. Other governance officers(?) may be invited to join the application, but will not be required to.
- All grant timelines must be approved by a quorum (or unanimous?) of the executive board.
- (will either CC or TB have any kind of mechanism for signaling disapproval or vetoing grant writing decisions? Maybe a quorum veto? or nothing...?)
- Funding timelines will be distributed throughout the governance structure at least (review period) before the start of the next grantwriting period.

## Elections
- Electing members onto executive board... (will anyone have a spot reserved?)
- Electing the chair of the executive board... (unless it's just always Josh; can just make Josh CFL until otherwise indicated)
